        <h2>About Emeralds</h2>
        <p>Emeralds are gem-quality specimens of the beryl mineral family with a rich, distinctly green color. They are among the most popular gemstones in the world and are particularly prized for their deep hues and often included appearance. The name “emerald” originated from the Persian Zumurud, meaning “green gems,” and gradually evolved into the Latin Smaragdus, which was then spelled “emerald” in English. Its Chinese name is the translation of the Persian word. A precious gem, emerald is the birthstone for May and the gem for the 55th anniversary of marriage. (The images are copyrighted!)</p>
